# Quantum Simulator  

A powerful **Quantum Simulator** written in **Rust** with a **React** frontend.  

---

### Current Features:  
- **Creating Qubits**: Easily initialize quantum bits.  
- **Displaying & Measuring Qubits**: Visualize and measure their quantum states.  
- **Applying Single-Qubit Gates**: Perform common quantum gate operations.

### Getting Started  

#### Running the Backend  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo link>
   ```
2. Install Rust from [Rust's Official Site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Make sure to add Rust's components (e.g., `cargo`) to your PATH during installation.
3. Navigate to quantum_simulator/backend
   ```bash
   cd quantum_simulator/backend
   ```
5. Run the backend with cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```
---

#### Running the frontend: 
1. Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone <repo link>
  ```
2. Install Node.js and npm from [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Ensure they are added to your PATH during installation.
3. Navigate to quantum_simulator/frontend
   ```bash
   cd quantum_simulator/frontend
   ```
4. Install the required Node.js packages:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Build and start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start 
   ```
